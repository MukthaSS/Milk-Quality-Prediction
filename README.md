### About the model
* It's a machine learning model used for classification tasks. The goal is to find a decision boundary (called a hyperplane) that best separates the data into different classes (e.g., spam vs non-spam).
* Kernel: In SVM, a kernel is a function that transforms data into a higher-dimensional space where it might be easier to separate classes.
* Linear Kernel: When you use a linear kernel, the model tries to separate the data using a straight line (in 2D) or a flat plane (in 3D). This kernel is suitable when the data is linearly separable, meaning it can be divided by a straight line or plane.

  ##### HEatmap;
   A heatmap is a data visualization technique that represents the magnitude of data values as colors in a matrix-like grid. It's especially useful for showing relationships or patterns in a large dataset, where each cell's color corresponds to the value of the data point.
* Rows and Columns: The heatmap is typically structured as a grid, with each row and column representing variables (such as features of a dataset or time intervals).
Color Intensity: The intensity or shade of color in each cell reflects the magnitude of the corresponding data point. For example, higher values might be represented with darker or warmer colors (like red), while lower values are represented with lighter or cooler colors (like blue).
